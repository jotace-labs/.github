# jotace-labs

Welcome to **jotace-labs** - my personal laboratory for cloud-native development and experimentation! 🚀

## About

This organization serves as my learning playground where I experiment with modern cloud-native technologies, treating each project like production-grade applications. It's designed to mirror real-world scenarios while providing a safe space for exploration and learning.

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Go (Golang)**: Primary language for building microservices
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration platform
- **ArgoCD**: GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes
- **k8s-argo-apps**: Deployment configuration and management

### Architecture
Projects in this organization follow a microservices architecture pattern, where:
- Each service is independently deployable
- Services are containerized using Docker
- Kubernetes manifests define service deployments
- ArgoCD handles GitOps-based deployments
- Infrastructure follows declarative configuration principles

## Purpose

This is a **study and learning environment** where I:
- 🎓 Practice cloud-native development patterns
- 🔧 Experiment with Go microservices architecture
- 🚢 Learn Kubernetes deployment strategies
- 🔄 Implement GitOps workflows with ArgoCD
- 📊 Test observability and monitoring solutions
- 🔐 Explore security best practices

## Project Structure

Each repository in this organization typically follows these principles:
- Clean architecture and separation of concerns
- Containerized deployments
- Kubernetes-ready configurations
- GitOps-compatible structure for ArgoCD
- Comprehensive documentation

## Deployment

Services are deployed using **k8s-argo-apps**, leveraging ArgoCD for GitOps-based continuous delivery:
- Application manifests are stored in Git
- ArgoCD syncs desired state with the cluster
- Automated deployments on configuration changes
- Easy rollback capabilities

## Learning Goals

Through this lab, I aim to gain hands-on experience with:
- Golang microservices development
- Container orchestration with Kubernetes
- GitOps practices and workflows
- Service mesh architectures
- Cloud-native observability
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- CI/CD pipelines

## Note

⚠️ **This is a personal learning laboratory.** Projects here are experimental and educational in nature. They may not follow all production best practices as they're designed for learning and experimentation.
